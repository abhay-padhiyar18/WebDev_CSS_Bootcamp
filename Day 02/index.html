    <h1> Introduction to Box Model </h1>
    <h1>Short Note on Box Model</h1>

    <p>
        The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and development that describes how elements on a web
        page are structured and how they interact with each other. It consists of four main components: content,
        padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for creating visually appealing and
        well-structured web layouts.

        1. Content: This is the innermost part of the box model and represents the actual content of the element, such
        as text, images, or other media. The size of the content area can be controlled using properties like width and
        height.

        2. Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. It provides breathing room
        around the content and can be adjusted using the padding property. Padding can be set uniformly on all sides or
        individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left).

        3. Border: The border surrounds the padding and content. It can be styled using properties like border-width,
        border-style, and border-color. Borders can also be rounded using the border-radius property.

        4. Margin: Margin is the outermost layer of the box model and creates space between the element and its
        neighboring elements. It can be adjusted using the margin property, similar to padding, allowing for uniform or
        individual side settings.

        The total size of an element is calculated by adding together the width and height of the content, padding,
        border, and margin. This means that when you set the width and height of an element, you need to consider these
        additional components to avoid unexpected layout issues.

        In summary, understanding the CSS box model is essential for effective web design. It allows developers to
        control spacing, alignment, and overall layout of elements on a web page, leading to a more polished and
        user-friendly experience.
