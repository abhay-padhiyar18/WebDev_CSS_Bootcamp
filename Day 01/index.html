    <h1>Day 7: No Space Left On Device</h1>

    <p>Today we are given a series of commands and outputs that represent a file system structure. We need to parse these commands to build a representation of the file system, calculate the sizes of directories, and then determine which directories meet certain size criteria.</p>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>We need to find all directories with a total size of at most 100
000 and sum their sizes.</p>
